## Introduction

Hello! I'm Girma Terfa, a computer science student with a passion for coding and problem-solving. My journey into the world of technology began like many others â€“ with a curiosity to understand how the digital realm works and a desire to create something of my own.

## About Me

I'm a curious individual who enjoys learning new things, both in and out of the tech world. Besides coding, I also love hiking, playing video games, and experimenting in the kitchen. One of my favorite pastimes is exploring the great outdoors, breathing in the fresh air, and taking in the breathtaking views nature has to offer.

## Pictures

Here are some of the pictures I took last time I went for hiking.
<!--![Hiking-picture](Hiking-image.jpg) -->

<img src="Hiking-image.jpg" width="400" height="300" alt="Hiking-picture">

The hike was not too challenging, and the stunning views made every step worth it. As I climbed higher, I couldn't help but feel a sense of accomplishment and wonder at the beauty that surrounded me.

## Core Markdown Constructs

### 1. My Coding Journey

While hiking allows me to appreciate the natural world, coding is where I find my true passion. It's a language that lets me bring my ideas to life, one line at a time. And what better way to learn and share my coding knowledge than through the power of Markdown?

#### Headings

# Heading 1
## Heading 2
### Heading 3

Headings are the backbone of any well-structured document, helping me to organize and categorize my thoughts and code.

### 2. Styling Text

With simple styling options like bold, italics, and strikethrough, I can add emphasis and clarity to my writing, making it easier for others to understand my code and thought process.

**Bold Text**  
*Italic Text*  
~~Strikethrough Text~~

### 3. Quoting Text

> "Any fool can write code that a computer can understand. Good programmers write code that humans can understand." - Martin Fowler

Quotes from experienced developers and industry leaders inspire me and remind me of the importance of writing clean, readable code.

### 4. Quoting Code

Here's an example of a bubble sort algorithm I recently learned:
```
public static void bubbleSort(int[] arr) {
   int n = arr.length;
   for (int i = 0; i < n - 1; i++) {
       for (int j = 0; j < n - i - 1; j++) {
           if (arr[j] > arr[j + 1]) {
               int temp = arr[j];
               arr[j] = arr[j + 1];
               arr[j + 1] = temp;
           }
       }
   }
}
```
Being able to share and discuss code snippets with my classmates and instructors has been invaluable in my learning journey.

### 5. Supported Color Models
Lately I was practicing how to make my outputs colorful in diffent programming languages. Because understanding color models is crucial for developing user interfaces, image processing algorithms, and other visual applications.<br>
<span style="color:red">Red text</span><br>
<span style="color:yellow">Yellow text</span><br>
<span style="color:green">Green text</span><br>

<font color="red">I like this</font>
<font color="yellow">feature</font>
<font color="green">as well</font>


### 6. External Links

I often refer to online resources like GitHub and FreeCodeCamp to deepen my understanding of coding concepts and stay up-to-date with the latest trends and best practices.
One of the most valuable resources for any computer science student is the wealth of online documentation and tutorials. I frequently refer to these resources to deepen my understanding of programming concepts and stay up-to-date with the latest technologies.<br>
GitHub: [https://github.com/MunGell/awesome-for-beginners](https://github.com/MunGell/awesome-for-beginners) <br>
In addition to github pages I also use other sites like [FreeCodeCamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org/).

### 7. Alerts
<p style="background-color:#FFF3CD; padding:10px; border-radius:5px;"><strong>&#9888; Warning</strong><br>
Remember to always test your code thoroughly before deploying it to production!
</p>

<p style="background-color:#D1ECF1; padding:10px; border-radius:5px;"><strong>&#9432; Note</strong><br>
Alerts help me highlight important information, warnings, or other critical messages, ensuring that I (and my team) don't miss crucial details.
</p>

### 8. Relative Links

Relative links allow me to connect various files within my projects, creating a cohesive and well-organized structure.

[Link to Another Markdown File in this project](README.md)

### 9. Images

I love incorporating images into my notes and documentation to help illustrate concepts and make them more engaging and memorable. But sometimes I don't want to show the image in text for different reasons. In that case, I use a link to the image like below:

[This is the picture we saw above](Hiking-image.jpg) 

### 10. Lists

Lists are a great way for me to keep track of my goals and tasks, ensuring I stay focused and motivated throughout my coding journey. Here are some goals I set for this coming summer:

#### Ordered List

1. Learn Python
2. Build a web application
3. Contribute to open-source projects

#### Unordered List

- Attend coding meetups
- Practice coding challenges
- Explore new programming languages

### 11. Task Lists

Although lists are great, task lists are more handy to manage those to-do lists. Task lists help me monitor my progress and celebrate my achievements, no matter how small. For example, I can easily mark off my list when it's done.

- [x] Enrolling for my winter classes
- [ ] Complete introductory Python course
- [ ] Build a personal website

### 12. Using Emojis

I recently completed a challenging coding assignment, and I couldn't be more excited! :smiley:  
:rocket:

Emojis add a touch of personality :green_heart:  and fun to my writing, making it more engaging and enjoyable for my readers (and:point_right: myself!).

### 13. Footnotes

I recently learned about the importance of writing clean code and following best practices.[^1]

[^1]: For more information, check out the book "Clean Code" by Robert C. Martin.

Footnotes are a useful tool for providing additional information or referencing sources without disrupting the flow of my writing.

### 14. Hiding Content with Comments

Comments allow me to include notes or temporarily hide sections of my document, making it easier to manage and maintain my code or writing.
for example I can hide this message by typing it like this: \<!-- This section is currently under construction. Stay tuned for updates! -->

### 15. Ignoring Markdown Formatting \

Sometimes, I need to include characters or symbols that would normally be interpreted as Markdown formatting. By escaping these characters, I can ensure that they are displayed as intended. Disabling Markdown rendering can be useful when I need to include code snippets or other text that should be displayed exactly as written, without any formatting applied.

\**This text will not be formatted as bold*\*

### 16. Mentioning People and Teams
As I'm enjoying and learning more about Markdown, I'd like to give a shoutout to my incredible classmates @coding-buddies and our amazing instructor @prof-johnson, who are being instrumental in my growth as a programmer.

Mentions allow me to recognize and appreciate the people who have supported and guided me along the way. It's also easy to mention someone in a group while collaborating.

### 17. Referencing Issues and Pull Requests

While working on a group project, we encountered an issue with the user authentication system (#3). Thanks to the collaboration of our team, we were able to resolve the issue and merge the fix (#5).

Referencing issues and pull requests helps me keep track of the development process and ensure that all concerns are addressed and changes are properly documented.

### 18. Referencing External Resources

When I'm stuck on a coding problem, I often refer to external resources like Stack Overflow for guidance and inspiration.
